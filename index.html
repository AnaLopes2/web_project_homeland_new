                The medieval ruins of Criccieth Castle overlook the town from a
                rock that juts out into the sea. It is believed to have been
                built by Llywelyn the Great in the 13th century. Around 900
                years later, the self-proclaimed Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                summer months.

                A short walk from Castle Street, you can enjoy the world's best
                ice cream at Cadwalader's, rumored to contain locally sourced
                seaweed as its secret ingredient. Another claim to fame is that
                Criccieth has won the Wales in Bloom award for five consecutive
                years, thanks to its spectacular floral displays throughout the
                town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman
                to have served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
