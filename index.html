                The medieval ruins of Criccieth Castle overlook the town from a
                rock that juts out into the sea. It is believed to have been
                built by Llywelyn the Great in the 13th century. Around 900
                years later, the self-proclaimed Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                summer months.

                ice cream at Cadwalader's, rumored to contain locally sourced
                seaweed as its secret ingredient. Another claim to fame is that
                Criccieth has won the Wales in Bloom award for five consecutive
                years, thanks to its spectacular floral displays throughout the
                town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman
                to have served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

                Berea is a small town located in central Kentucky, USA.
                Surrounded by beautiful forests and fields, it is known as the
                state's capital of crafts. Visitors will find numerous shopping
                opportunities, including stores offering handmade jewelry,
                candles, wooden items, galleries, glass workshops, and much
                more. The town hosts an annual festival celebrating
                "spoonbread," a local dish made with cornmeal bread and
                traditionally served with a wooden spoon. This festival features
                a variety of vendors, free entertainment, and activities
                suitable for all ages.

                However, it is probably best known for the local college. Berea
                College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                South to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                coeducational. In a rather unique way, it does not charge
                tuition - every student receives a full scholarship.

                Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the era of
                the kingdom, Muramvya was the royal capital, and in 2007, due to
                its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO
                World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of
                Burundi, between the country's political and economic capitals.

                The climate is quite cold at night, but during the day, you
                would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 feet) above
                sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                province. But this cool breeze allows for one of the largest tea
                and coffee plantations in the country, which represent the
                majority of Burundi's exports.

                The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves

                Divide mountains, ranging from 1,550 to 2,660 meters in
                altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation and serves as a

                throughout the country.
